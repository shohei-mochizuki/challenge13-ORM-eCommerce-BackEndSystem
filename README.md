## INSTALLATION 
This application requires 1.JavaScript, 2.Node.JS (version 16, not the latest) and 3.Node package manager to run. In a blank folder, put necessary files (refer to the TESTS section for the details) and open the command line. In the command line, move to this folder and then type "npm install". Make sure that a folder called "node_modules" and a file called package-lock.json are created. Following libraries are used:
* express
* mysql2
* sequelize
* dotenv

## USAGE 
### Step 1. Data Preparation 
First you need to load your data onto MySQL server. Go to Command Line and go to the folder of this application which contains db folder and index.js. Once you're in the folder, type "mysql -u root" (if you get a server connection error, type "mysql.server start" first) and then you're ready to use MySQL. In MySQL, type "source db/schema.sql;" first and then "source db/seeds.sql;". Now this database is available in MySQL and you can exit MySQL by typing "quit" and hit Enter button.  

### Step 2. Data Management
In Command Line, type "node index.js". It takes you to the list of actions. Choose the option you'd like. Keep in mind the following rules:
* Name of a department cannot be longer than 30 characters
* Name of a role/title cannot be longer than 30 characters
* First and last names of an employee cannot be longer than 30 characters
* Salary should be a number. Do not input "k" or "$" marks
